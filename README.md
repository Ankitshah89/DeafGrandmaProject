# Deaf Grandma Project

## Overview

We are going to see your sweet old Grandma. Unfortunately, she can't hear very well (she would never admit it, but she's stone cold deaf). This application will mirror our interactions with Grandma.
* The user is prompted to say something to Grandma.
* Grandma can only hear the user if the user yells (writes in capital letters).
* When Grandma doesn't hear you, she yells a phrase such as "huh? speak up billy!" (all lowercase)
* When Grandma does hear you, she yells something like "NO, NOT SINCE THE WAR". (ALL CAPS)
* Grandma will keep trying to have a conversation with you until you yell "GOODBYE". (ALL CAPS)
* When you yell goodbye at Grandma she yells back something like "NAMASTE!" (ALL CAPS)
* Grandma chooses from a different set of phrases for her affirmative (hears you), negative (doesn't hear you), and farewell phrases.

* Object Oriented Programming
* How classes are created to make an objecta

* Difference between static and instance fields


_This was a fun project as we move more into object oriented programming in the coming days._
